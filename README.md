# Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features like year of manufacture, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide a reliable and data-driven estimation of car prices.

## Project Overview

In today's fast-paced world, estimating the right selling price for a used car can be challenging. This project uses historical car data to build a predictive model that helps sellers and buyers make informed decisions. The model analyzes key features of a car and predicts its expected selling price.

### Key Features
- **Dataset**: Contains information on various cars, including features like year, present price, fuel type, kilometers driven, and more.
- **Models Used**:
  - **Linear Regression** (baseline model)
  - **Ridge Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **XGBoost Regressor**
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (RÂ²)
- **Visualizations**: Scatter plots comparing actual vs. predicted prices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Results

The model produces predictions with minimal error, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and other metrics. We compared multiple models to ensure the best performance.

Disclaimer
This project is for experimental learning purposes and is not intended for commercial use. The predictions and models developed here are based on a limited dataset and should not be used as a sole factor in decision-making for car pricing.
